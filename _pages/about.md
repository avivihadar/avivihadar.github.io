<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;" src="/images/Hadar2.jpeg" width="310"> Welcome! I am a labor economist. I study intergenerational mobility, inequality, and policy design.

Beginning in September 2025, I will join the Department of Economics at University College London as an Assistant Professor after spending one year as a post-doctoral fellow in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2024.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_HA.pdf).

My fields of interest are labor economics and applied econometrics. 

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I graduated from Tel-Aviv University and worked as a research assistant at The Hebrew University, The Israeli Democracy Institute and The Research Department of Bank of Israel.
