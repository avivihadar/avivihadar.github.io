<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;" src="/images/Hadar2.jpeg" width="310"> Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at the University College London. I study topics in labor economics, intergenerational mobility, and applied econometrics.

I received a Ph.D. in Economics from UC Berkeley in 2024, and spent the '24-'25 academic year as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University.
