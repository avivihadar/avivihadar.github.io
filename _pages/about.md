<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="320">I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I graduated from Tel-Aviv University and worked as a research assistant in The Hebrew University, the Israel Democracy Institute and the Research department of Bank of Israel. 

My fields of interest are labor economics and applied econometrics. Specifically, I work on projects related to discrimination, intergenerational mobility, and job search.

You can contact me at havivi[at]berkeley[at]edu. You can find my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv_12-09-19_jmp_long.pdf).
