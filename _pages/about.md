<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="420"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I graduated from Tel-Aviv University and worked as a research assistant at The Hebrew University, The Israeli Democracy Institute and The Research Department of Bank of Israel. 

My fields of interest are labor economics and applied econometrics.
