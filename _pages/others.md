# Two figures
## Covid19 and the labor market, Israel
Here are two figures we made as a part of a collaboration we ([Tslil Aloni](https://sites.google.com/view/tslil-aloni/home?authuser=0)  and I) started with a large Israeli job-board to share information about the labor market during COVID19. 
The first graph shows the supply of workers as portrayed in this job-board website, while the second shows the demand activity on the side of the employers. 
Looks like firms want workers!

[comment]: <> (In the early months of the Coronavirus pandemic, where no real-time labor market data were available, Tslil Aloni and I planted the seeds for a long-term collaboration with the Israeli job board .)

[comment]: <> (The first but not the last! output is a descriptive statistics of the Israeli labor market during the pandemic, as it is being reflected in Drushim’s website.)

[comment]: <> (The full report will be available soon on Drushim’s website. Here we provide just a few figures:)
