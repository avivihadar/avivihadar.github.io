## Covid19 in Israel

In the early months of the Coronavirus pandemic, where no real-time labor market data were available, Tslil Aloni and I planted the seeds for a long-term collaboration with the Israeli job board [Drushim](https://www.drushim.co.il/?ref=198&gclid=Cj0KCQiA5vb-BRCRARIsAJBKc6LCTqC58lQR2Quyk3jHGA8P2BH81-GFFFZYR7FbUFbXgg7WPMYAwW8aAk18EALw_wcB).

The first (but not the last!) output is a descriptive statistics of the Israeli labor market during the pandemic, as it is being reflected in Drushim’s website.

The full report will be available soon on Drushim’s website. Here we provide just a few figures:
